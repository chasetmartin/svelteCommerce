# sveltePriceEstimator

## This is an example SvelteKit ecommerce pricing estimator, what could become part of a larger platform where users can login and save their estimates / shopping history. 

* Each window estimate is saved to a MySQL Planetscale database using Prisma as an ORM
* Estimates are immediately displayed back to the user using server-side data loading that queries the database for the existance of a user's estimate.
* The app is styled using TailwindCSS.
* The site is password protected since it is for demo purposes and has no built-in auth. Message me to access the live site.

-- This is not deployment ready - it is just to show off my CRUD abilities in SvelteKit using an ORM and simple database.

-- The Login / Logout functionality are not setup at this time.
