# svelteCommerce_prisma

## Description

### This is an example SvelteKit ecommerce pricing estimator, where user can create estimates for window inserts for their home. Each window estimate is saved to a sqlite development database using Prisma as an ORM. The app is styled using TailwindCSS.

This is not deployment ready - it is just to show my CRUD abilities in SvelteKit.

The Login / Logout functionality are not setup.
