# sveltePriceEstimator

## Description

### This is an example SvelteKit ecommerce pricing estimator, where users can create estimates for buying window inserts for their home/business. Each window estimate is saved to a sqlite development database using Prisma as an ORM, then immediately displayed back to the user. The app is styled using TailwindCSS.

This is not deployment ready - it is just to show my CRUD abilities in SvelteKit.

The Login / Logout functionality are not setup.
